# Submitting Individual Assignments

This guide will walk you through how to submit each of your assignments.

**NOTE** Pushing any new commits after the submission deadline is not allowed.

## Preparing your repository

Your repository should be well documented and be able to compile and run before you submit your assignment. Any commented out and/or uneeded code should be deleted before submission

## Submitting your assignment

To submit your assignment, simply determine the name of your last commit (using `git log`) and submit it as a plaintext via canvas. If you have pushed any new commits **before the submission deadline**, you should re-submit the assignment on canvas with the latest commit.
